# Asymptotic notation

## Big-O
- upper bounds the growth rate of a function up to a constant
- If f(n)/g(n) = c for 0 ≤ c < ∞ then f(n) = O(g(n))

## Big-Ω
- lower bounds
- f(n) = Ω(g(n)) iif g(n) = O(f(n))

## Small-o
- f(n) = o(g(n)) if and only if f(n)/g(n) = 0
- e.g: 100n and e^n (derivative both)

## Small-w
- f(n) = w(g(n)) iif g(n) = o(f(n))

# Graph
## Simple graph
- Undirected and unweighted
- No self loop
- No parallel edges

## induced subgraph
- a subset of the vertices in the original graph together with all of the edges running between them.
