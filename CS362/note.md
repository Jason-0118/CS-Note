# [Product Vision](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/05/09/product-vision/)

## The pattern to explain the project to someone within tow mins
- For (tarfet customer)
- Who (statement of the need or opportunity)
- The (product name) is a (product category)
- That (key benefit, compelling reason to buy)
- Unlike (primary competitive alternative)
- Our product (statement of primary differentiation)

example:
“For a mid-sized company’s marketing and sales departments who need basic CRM functionality, the CRM-Innovator is a Web-based service that provides sales tracking, lead generation, and sales representative support features that improve customer relationships at critical touch points. Unlike other services or package software products, our product provides very capable services at a moderate cost.”


## Benefits of vision statement
1. helps teams remain focused on the critical aspects of the product

"every project should be considered to produce a “product.” Whether the project results involve enhancements to an internal accounting system or a new e-commerce site, product-oriented thinking pays back benefits."


## Steps to get team to think about a product vision 
1. Design-the-Box exercise (developed originally by colleague Bill Shakelford)
2. In this exercise the entire team, including users, breaks up into groups of four to six (this works best with cross-functional participation).
3. The team makes the assumption that the product will be sold in a shrink-wrapped box, and their task is to design the product box front and back. (This involves coming up with a product name, a graphic, three to four key bullet points on the front to “sell” the product, a detailed feature description on the back, and operating requirements.)
4. Presentations by each of the groups are then followed by discussing how the multiple focal points can be reduced to a few that everyone agrees upon.
5. Once this exercise has been completed, the group can then work on constructing their own version of Moore’s product vision statement.
6. Finally, the group can construct a good outline for a complete one- to three-page product vision document that might include: 
    - the mission statement
    - a project profile overview (scope, schedule, cost, defects) with priorities
    - pictures of the “boxes” 
    - target customers and each of their needs
    - customer satisfaction measures
    - key technology and operational requirements
    - critical product constraints (performance, ease of use, volumes), and key financial indicators.
